3. Join our [GeoDev Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/co-geodev-workshop/shared_invite/enQtMjUxOTA1Mzc5OTU5LWQzNThiYTMzMzYwYmY0MzgxMGI4MTBkNGY1MGNmNjIxMWJjN2Q4NmEzMWNmNzcxOGY1NWY2ZTgwYjZhMmEwODA)

   * Optional download the slack client [https://slack.com/downloads/](https://slack.com/downloads/)

## Part 1 - Data
Creating and importing data interactively is a fast and effective way to prepare data for both prototype and production app development.

1. *[Import Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/import-data/) 

2. [Create a New Dataset](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/create-a-new-dataset/)

3. *[Explore Layer Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/explore-layer-data/) 

4. [Query Layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/query-layers/)

5. Code Challenge: [Create 2D Map with a Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/create-a-2d-map-with-a-layer/)


## Part 2 - Design
Learning to create web maps with great cartography is one of the most important steps to building effective mapping applications. Styling maps interactively can also be huge time-saver in app development.

1. *Create a [Web Map in 2D](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-map/) or create a [Web Scene in 3D](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-scene/) 

2. [Style a Web Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/style-a-web-map/) 

3. *[Configure a Popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/configure-pop-ups/)
 
4. [Style Layers with Smart Mapping](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/style-your-layers-with-smart-mapping/)

## Part 3 - Develop
One of the easiest ways to build an ArcGIS map app is to start with a web map, but you can also use the various
ArcGIS APIs and SDKs to build applications from templates or from scratch.

1. *[Add a Web Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/display-a-web-map/)

2. [Add a Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/create-a-2d-map-with-a-layer/)

3. [Query a Feature Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/query-a-feature-layer/)

4. [Style a Feature Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/style-a-feature-layer/)

5. [Configure a Popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/configure-a-popup/)

6. Coding Challenges
  *  *[Calcite Maps/Bootstrap](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps) [Solution](https://codepen.io/alaframboise/pen/dVKEmg)
 
  * Use the ArcGIS REST API to [Query a FeatureLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/query-a-feature-layer/)
